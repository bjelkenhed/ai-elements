This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

It is a repository for getting started with [AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/overview).

For a youtube tutorial see [Fullstack AI Chatbot with AI SDK 5 & Vercelâ€™s New AI Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lur_Yit4PM).

## Getting Started

First create a .env.local file in the root directory with a AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY 

An API key can be created [here](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys&title=Get%20your%20AI%20Gateway%20key)
or ask to borrow one from a friendly colleague.

When, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

So far this repository showcases this [chatbot](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements/examples/chatbot)
